# CAR-FEATURES-ON-PRICE-AND-PROFITABILITY
How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand
•	This problem could be approached by analysing the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer.

•	 By using data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts

•	The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP"
